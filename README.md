# Exploring Weather Trends - Data Analysis
This was my first DA project focused on exploring a dataset and making visualizations using Python's Matplotlib. (Completed on 9th December, 2019)

## Description

The goal was to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where I live (in my case, Delhi).

Understanding the patterns in the data I made observations and used different techniques  to further analyze the data.

## Usage

Python needs to be installed for this to work. It can be downloaded from [this](https://www.python.org/downloads/) website. Python right now comes in two stable versions namely, Python v3.7 and Python v2.7.

After installing Python, you'll need to install some modules that are required using the command line.

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
```

## Observations

Please find the observations from the project in the project report.
